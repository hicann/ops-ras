# Introduction

CANN Simulator is a SoC-level chip simulation tool designed for operator development scenarios. It analyzes the accuracy and performance data (such as instruction execution status) of AI tasks running on the AI simulator at each stage. This tool helps users perform deep performance tuning, enabling developers to obtain verification results and performance feedback nearly consistent with real chips even when real chips are unavailable or chip resources are scarce.

# Main Functions

This tool maintains binary compatibility with on-board execution (the same kernel can be executed on both the simulator and the AI processor). The main uses are as follows:

* Accuracy simulation: Outputs bit-level accuracy results, helping users complete operator accuracy verification.
* Performance simulation: Outputs instruction pipeline diagrams, helping users identify operator performance bottlenecks.

# Preparation Before Use

## Usage Constraints

* Recommended tool environment configuration: CPU with 16 cores or more, memory of 32 GB or more.
* All paths mentioned in this document must ensure that the running user has read or read-write permissions.
* For security and minimal permissions, it is recommended to use regular user permissions to execute this tool. Avoid using root or other high-privilege accounts.
* This tool depends on the CANN software package. Before using it, install the CANN software package. Driver and firmware installation is not required. Execute the CANN set_env.sh environment variable file through the source command. For security, do not modify the environment variables involved in set_env.sh after executing the source command.
* Users should follow the principle of least privilege. For example, files input to the tool must not be writable by other users. In some more stringent security scenarios, ensure that input files are not writable by group users.
* This tool is a development tool and is not recommended for use in production environments.
* The simulation function of the tool only supports single-card scenarios and cannot simulate multi-card environments. Only card 0 can be set in the code. Modifying the visible card number will cause simulation failure.
* The simulation environment only supports AI Core computation-type operators (MC2 and HCCL type operators are not supported).
* The CANN Simulator tool is currently in the early-access version stage and only supports the Ascend950PR chip. It is recommended that the simulator running environment be configured with a 16-core CPU and 32 GB or more memory.
* ARM environment simulation is not supported at this time.

## Environment Preparation

CANN Simulator is integrated in the CANN toolkit package. Complete the software package installation by following [Environment Deployment](../context/quick_install.md).

# Quick Start

The following uses [add_examples](../../../examples/add_example/) as an example to describe operator simulation in detail.

## Operator Compilation

* Complete the add_example operator compilation and installation by following [Operator Invocation](../invocation/quick_op_invocation.md).

```bash
# Note: Enter the project root directory and execute the following compilation command. The command is for reference only. For details, refer to the operator invocation instructions.
bash build.sh --pkg --soc=Ascend950 --vendor_name=custom --ops=add_example
# Install the custom operator package
./build_out/cann-ops-nn-${vendor_name}_linux-${arch}.run
```

* Complete the compilation of test_aclnn_add_example.cpp by following [aclnn Invocation](../invocation/op_invocation.md#aclnn-invocation), and generate the executable file test_aclnn_add_example.

## Execute Simulation Command

```bash
cannsim record ./test_aclnn_add_example -s Ascend950 --gen-report
```

The simulation tool execution log files are in the examples/add_example/examples/build/bin/cannsim_* directory. The execution log file is:

```bash
cannsim.log
```

From the simulation tool log file, you can see the print information in the sample:

```bash
add_example first input[0] is: 1.000000, second input[0] is: 1.000000, result[0] is: 2.000000
add_example first input[1] is: 1.000000, second input[1] is: 1.000000, result[1] is: 2.000000
add_example first input[2] is: 1.000000, second input[2] is: 1.000000, result[2] is: 2.000000
add_example first input[3] is: 1.000000, second input[3] is: 1.000000, result[3] is: 2.000000
add_example first input[4] is: 1.000000, second input[4] is: 1.000000, result[4] is: 2.000000
add_example first input[5] is: 1.000000, second input[5] is: 1.000000, result[5] is: 2.000000
add_example first input[6] is: 1.000000, second input[6] is: 1.000000, result[6] is: 2.000000
```

## View Performance Pipeline

The simulation performance pipeline files are in the `examples/add_example/examples/build/bin/cannsim_*/report` directory of this project. The pipeline-related file is:

```bash
trace_core0.json
```

Enter "chrome://tracing" in the Chrome browser and drag the generated instruction pipeline diagram file (trace_core0.json) to the blank area to open it. For specific parameter descriptions, refer to the "Simulation Result Analysis" section.

# Simulation Execution Instructions

## Command Function

Execute the application in the simulation environment.

## Command Format

cannsim record [options] user_app --user-options

## Parameter Description

Table 1 Simulation Execution Parameter Description

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|-s or --soc-version [options] parameter | Required | Specify the target chip version for simulation (for example: Ascend950).|
|-o or --output [options] parameter | Optional| The path where the generated files are stored. It can be configured as an absolute path or a relative path, and the user executing the tool must have read-write permissions. If the path is not specified, data is saved in the current directory by default.|
|-g or --gen-report [options] parameter | Optional | Enable automatic analysis after simulation completion and generate an analysis report. By default, automatic analysis is not enabled.|
|user_app|Required|Operator executable file.|
|--user-options|Optional|Running parameters of the operator executable file.|

## Usage Example

1. Complete operator development and compilation.
2. Execute the simulation command. Refer to the following usage examples:

    ```text
    Method 1: Enable simulation and save the output to the ./output directory. /path/to/app is the operator program.
    $ cannsim record /path/to/app -o ./output -s Ascend950

    Method 2: Enable simulation and generate a report for subsequent performance analysis.
    $ cannsim record /path/to/app -o ./output -s Ascend950 --gen-report
    ```

3. After the command completes, a folder named "cannsim_{timestamp}_${user_app}" is generated in the default path or the specified "output" directory. The structure example is as follows:

    ```text
    ├─cannsim_{timestamp}_${user_app}
    ├── cannsim.log
    ```

4. You can obtain the operator execution results and compare the accuracy. The results are displayed in cannsim.log. An example is as follows:

    The following output is only an example of the AscendC single-operator direct invocation accuracy comparison result. It may vary slightly depending on the version. Please refer to the actual output.

    ```bash
    INFO:root:[INFO] compare data case[ case001]
    INFO:root:---------------RESULT---------------
    INFO:root:['case_name', 'wrong_num', 'total_num', 'result', 'task_duration']
    INFO:root:[' case001', 0, 65536, 'Success']
    ```
